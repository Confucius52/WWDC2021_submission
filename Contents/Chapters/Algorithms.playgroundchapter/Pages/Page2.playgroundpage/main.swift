## Flood Fill 
 
Another simple graph algorithm is Flood Fill, the paint bucket algorithm. It's often used to find "connected components" within a graph. In other words, if any 2 squares can reach other, we give them the same color (like a paint bucket)

Asides literally serving as a paint bucket, there are more subtle uses as well. Strategies like these help us understand the relationships in a network, much like how Google does their page ranking or how youtube might recommend you videos.

TODO:
dijkstra, 
a* heuristics (based on euclidean and manhattan distance),
jump searching,

bidirectional search (for large search spaces),

maybe talk about traveling salesman
